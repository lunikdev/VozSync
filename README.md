# VozSync
This project is divided into two parts: one runs on the user's machine and the other can run in the cloud or locally. The user can send audio from their microphone to the cloud machine, which transcribes the audio and returns the transcribed text.

## Installation

It is recommended to use a virtual environment to manage dependencies:

1. **Create and activate a virtual environment:**

    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    .\venv\Scripts\activate
    ```

2. **Install the required packages:**

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

**Alternatively**, you can install the dependencies directly without a virtual environment (not recommended):

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt


Using a virtual environment helps to keep your project dependencies isolated and manageable.
